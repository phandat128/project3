Both the Palestinians and the Israelis are legitimately angered at the lives that they are forced to lead: For the Palestinians, the anger about individual events – the civilian casualties, injuries and destruction in Gaza following from military attacks, the blockade, the continued construction of the Wall outside of the 1967 borders – feed into an underlying anger about the continuing Israeli occupation, its daily humiliations and their as-yet-unfulfilled right to self-determination. For the Israelis, the public statements of Palestinian armed groups celebrating rocket and mortar attacks on civilians strengthen a deep-rooted concern that negotiation will yield little and that their nation remains under existential threat from which only it can protect its people.
The list included two former presidents (Bill Clinton and Barack Obama), Hillary Clinton, former Attorney General Eric Holder; a former CIA director; a former director of National Intelligence; two likely Democratic presidential candidates in 2020; a black congresswoman whom Trump frequently describes as “low IQ” (a common racist charge); two prominent Jewish billionaire philanthropists, one of whom, George Soros, is a frequent target of Trump and the subject of various right-wing conspiracy fantasies; and the actor Robert De Niro (who began his speech at this year’s Tony Awards ceremony by declaring, “Fuck Trump”).
Consider just a few examples: Anat Admati and Simon Johnson have advocated radical banking reforms; Thomas Piketty and Tony Atkinson have proposed a rich menu of policies to deal with inequality at the national level; Mariana Mazzucato and Ha-Joon Chang have written insightfully on how to deploy the public sector to foster inclusive innovation; Joseph Stiglitz and José Antonio Ocampo have proposed global reforms; Brad DeLong, Jeffrey Sachs, and Lawrence Summers (the very same!) have argued for long-term public investment in infrastructure and the green economy.
Obama and his congressional allies enacted an $800 billion “stimulus” bill that was loaded with programs geared to key Democratic constituencies, such as environmentalists and public employees; adopted a sweeping and highly unpopular health-care reform (whose constitutionality will be determined by the Supreme Court this year); imposed vast new regulations on wide swaths of the economy; embraced an industrial policy that selects certain companies for special treatment; engaged in borrowing and spending at levels exceeded only in World War II; and centralized power in Washington, DC (and, within the federal government, in the executive branch and regulatory agencies).
Of this amount, around $2 billion was received by the five best-paid individuals, who were also central to creating the highly risky asset structures that brought the financial system to the edge of the abyss: Sandy Weil (built Citigroup, which blew up shortly after he left); Hank Paulson (greatly expanded Goldman Sachs, lobbied for allowing more leverage in investment banks, then moved to the US Treasury and helped save them); Angelo Mozilo (built Countrywide, a central player in irresponsible mortgage lending); Dick Fuld (ran Lehman Brothers into the ground); and Jimmy Cayne (ran Bear Stearns into the ground).
The real losers of the election were the Social Democrats, with a drop in support of 11% that is without precedent in the very stable history of German electoral behavior. Some on the left claim that the SPD’s catastrophic result was the product of too close an engagement with liberalism and deregulation. According to this view, the party is now paying the price for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s successful attempts at economic reform in the early 2000’s. It seems more likely that the party was punished for its lackluster electoral campaign, and for the negativity with which it tried to present the outcome of the election (the center-right coalition) as a threat to social peace in Germany.
A social market economy, rather than unbridled market capitalism; an export economy built on a large and technically innovative manufacturing base; a large network of small and medium sized enterprise, often family-owned, that is open to the global economy; a sense of environmental responsibility; and a suspicion of financially driven Anglo-Saxon style globalization and corporate capitalism. Indeed the sense that Germany had the opportunity to show off the unique strengths of the “German model” was a key to Merkel’s appeal, and she repeatedly noted what a tough line she had taken against the position of banks.
Financial activity was concentrated largely in what the Europeans termed “Anglo-Saxon” economies: above all the United States and the United Kingdom, and a few small countries that tried, disastrously, to replicate a model of free-for-all finance such as Iceland and Ireland. But the emerging markets that drive globalization in the early twenty-first century have a similar mix of export orientation and a prominent industrial base of small and medium-sized and frequently family-owned enterprises. They have the problem today of trying to reconcile dynamic growth and social cohesion that was the problem of Germany in the past, and to which the German social model was and is held up as the answer.
The sudden downfall of Bo Xilai – and the call from Yunnan Province for the removal of the two Politburo members closest to him – is just one example of the no-holds-barred infighting now taking place in Zhongnanhai, the closed leadership compound in Beijing. Indeed, the internecine squabbles are said to be so vicious that there have been rumors, denied by the regime, that the Communist Party’s congress at which a new president and prime minister are to be anointed this autumn, might be postponed.
From 1993 to 2001 a series of abrasive encounters poisoned the atmosphere: the forced boarding of a Chinese merchant ship (wrongly suspected of carrying chemical warfare components to Iran) in the Arabian Gulf; US efforts to block China's bid to host the 2000 Olympics; escalating tensions over Taiwan; the Wen Ho Lee affair (where China was falsely implicated in the theft of American nuclear secrets); the accidental bombing of China's embassy by US warplanes during the Kosovo war; and the mid-air collision of a US spy plane and a Chinese jet fighter last year.
MANILA – The death of President Corazon Cojuangco Aquino – "Tita Cory" to most of the 92 million people of the Philippines – left behind a precious inheritance: a legacy of freedom that the Philippines came to share with oppressed peoples around the world. For her revolution was the first of the wave of “velvet revolutions” that liberated countless millions from Manila to Seoul to Johannesburg to Prague, Warsaw and Moscow. President Aquino’s "People Power" revolution, indeed, is among the proudest moments in my country’s history, and the distinctive contribution of our people to the saga of mankind's long struggle for freedom and dignity.
Cory Aquino motivated ordinary Filipinos to peaks of daring and selflessness at a time when their spirit had almost been broken by a 14-year dictatorship. While her husband Ninoy Aquino lived, she – as the unassuming but caring housewife – was the stabilizing influence that tempered his dynamic personality. But after the assassination of Senator Ninoy Aquino in August 1983, she stepped resolutely into his role as political leader of my country’s democratic opposition to an entrenched despotic regime.
In fact, even some “techno-libertarians,” who believe that government should not regulate new developments in biotechnology, have supported the US Food and Drug Administration’s decision – outlined in a scathing letter to 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki last November – to prevent the firm from marketing its tests pending further scientific analysis. “I’d like to be able to argue that the [FDA] is wantonly standing in the way of entrepreneurism and innovation by cracking down on 23andMe,” wrote Matthew Herper in Forbes.
And here’s the even greater truth: to bestow it on one of our last popular poets, the distant relative of Rutebeuf, Villon, and all the minstrels and songsters of solitude and dereliction; to consecrate a troubadour, a bard of the brotherhood of lonely and lost souls; to crown the author of ballads that have been, to borrow André Suarès’s phrase about Rimbaud, “a moment in the life” of so many people in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries makes a lot more sense than pulling out of a hat the obscure Rudolf Christoph Eucken or picking poor old Sully Prudhomme instead of Tolstoy.
Just consider what must be overcome: economic divergence and deepening recessions; irreversible balkanization of the banking system and financial markets; unsustainable debt burdens for public and private agents; daunting growth and balance-sheet costs in countries that pursue internal devaluation and deflation to restore competitiveness; asymmetrical adjustment, with moral-hazard risks in the core and insufficient financing in the periphery fueling incompatible political dynamics; fickle and impatient markets and investors; austerity fatigue in the periphery and bailout fatigue in the core; the absence of conditions for an optimal currency area; and serious difficulties in achieving full fiscal, banking, economic, and political union.
Hasan Abd al-Rahman, head of the notorious, Stasi-like State Security Investigations (SSI); Ahmad Ramzi, head of the Central Security Forces (CSF); Adly Fayyid, the head of Public Security; Ismail al-Shaer, who led the Cairo Security Directorate (CSD); Osama Youssef, the head of the Giza Security Directorate; and Omar Faramawy, who oversaw of the 6th of October Security Directorate, were all cleared of any wrongdoing.
All relevant regulators were present: Mary Miller, Under Secretary for Domestic Finance at the Treasury Department; Dan Tarullo, Governor of the Federal Reserve System; Marty Gruenberg, Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); Tom Curry, Comptroller of the Currency; Richard Cordray, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; Elisse Walter, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and Gary Gensler, Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Those images are of children’s shriveled, vitrified bodies; of the wounded whose limbs, for lack of drugs, have been amputated by desperate doctors who are soon massacred themselves; of women mown down by rocket fire, as in Sarajevo 24 years ago, while waiting in line to buy yogurt or bread; of volunteers struck down while digging through the rubble in search of survivors; of human beings drained of strength, surviving in filth and waste, saying goodbye to life.
PRAGUE -- Five years ago, the European Union was on the verge of fulfilling one of the aspirations of the Velvet Revolutions that swept across Central and Eastern Europe by expanding from 15 to 25 members through the accession of several post-communist states. Yet, while the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain may have fallen into the dustbin of history, others vestiges of the Soviet era remain firmly in place. Certain areas of the world have been transformed for the better, even as others have been suspended in time to fend for themselves. One place that has not changed is Cuba, despite Fidel Castro’s decision to retire and hand the reigns of power over to his brother Raul.
On March 18th five years ago, Castro’s government cracked down on the Varela Project and other civil society initiatives rather than risk allowing a spark of democratic reform to spread across Cuba as it had in the former Soviet bloc. The seventy five prisoners of conscience locked up were dissidents, independent journalists, leaders from civil society, and librarians, who had dared to speak the truth openly about what life is like in Cuba. Even though four prisoners have recently been released, fifty five of the seventy five remain incarcerated in deplorable conditions. In general, the only reason that any of these prisoners were freed was because of how seriously their health had deteriorated.
MANILA – China’s government has just announced that Premier Wen Jiabao will be the main speaker at the 2009 Boao Forum for Asia, where the roster of leaders expected to participate is a virtual Who’s Who of the continent: President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, President Faure Gnassingbe of Togo, Prime Minister S. Bayar of Mongolia, Prime Minister Thein Sein of Myanmar, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung of Vietnam, Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand, and Kopsak Saphawasu, Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand.
The list is alarming. After the attacks on Charlie Hebdo and a kosher grocery in January 2015, there was the mass murder committed at the Bataclan theater and other Paris sites in November 2015; the truck attack on Nice’s Promenade des Anglais this summer; the subsequent murder at a Catholic church in Normandy of a beloved priest, whose throat was cut during mass; the attack on a private home outside Paris, where a married couple of police officers were murdered in front of their child; and the stabbing of a Jewish man in Strasbourg this month.
Coincidentally, in the same week that Germany and the World Jewish Congress rejected the idea that defamation of religion is an affront to human dignity, and upheld the right to freedom of expression, Germany’s highest court issued its ruling on a case brought by a Jewish organization, and two Jewish individuals. The court ruled against the right of the United States-based animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to exhibit posters that juxtapose photographs of victims of the Holocaust with photographs of animals in factory farms and at slaughterhouses.
NEW YORK– In one week, Michelle Obama sat for a formal White House portrait, dressed in somber, tailored clothes; posed for a snazzy People magazine cover, dressed in a slightly down-market, hot-pink lace outfit that showed plenty of skin; let the national media know that the First Family would be getting its new puppy from a rescue shelter; and had her press office mention casually that “secretaries and policy makers” had been invited for popcorn and movies at the White House.
It does not seem to be an accident, though, that the capture came quickly after the Security Council passed a very specific set of sanctions against Iran that targeted not just IRGC-affiliated companies and financial institutions like the Ammunition and Metallurgy Industries Group and the Bank Sepah, organizations dealing with nuclear or ballistic missile activities, but also a series of senior IRGC commanders, including Morteza Rezaei, the Guards’ deputy commander, Vice Admiral Ali Ahmadian, chief of the Joint Staff, and Brigadier General Mohammad Hejazi, commander of the Basij.
Nevertheless, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s description of the Israeli raid on the activists’ boat as “an attack on the conscience of humanity,” which “deserves every kind of curse,” and as a “turning point in history” after which “nothing will be the same,” seems hysterical. Whatever one thinks of various Israeli governments (and I don’t think much of the current one), reactions to Israeli government-sponsored violence tend to be much fiercer – not just in Turkey – than to crimes committed by the leaders of other countries, with the exception perhaps of the United States.
The most recent Congressional legislation makes the path to citizenship almost as difficult as the trip across the border, and all three candidates supported that bill. If looking for courage on immigration, however, Senator Obama, the son of an African father and an American mother, might have more than the others. He’s been the only candidate to defend the right of the undocumented to get a legal driver’s license – a proposal unpopular with many voters. Although it took a prostitution ring to bring the former Governor Eliot Spitzer down, his plan to give illegal immigrants the undocumented in New York driving licenses—what most experts say makes a whole lot of sense in terms of safer highways -- proved his first miscalculation. Even the then popular leader had to shelve it.
Then, at the end of the eighteenth century, the founders of the United States of America and their intellectual successors claimed that this pessimism about government was unwarranted. “The science of politics...like most other sciences,” claimed Alexander Hamilton, “has received great improvement....The regular distribution of power into distinct departments...legislative balances and checks...judges holding their offices during good behavior; the representation of the people in the legislature by deputies of their own election...are means, and powerful means, by which the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided...”
Like the rest of the Moros (as the Muslim peoples of Mindanao are known), the Maranaos (or “People of the Lake,” because they have built their lives and homes by Lake Lanao) were never conquered or colonized by the Spanish, the Americans, or the Japanese, as opposed to other Filipinos from the Luzon and Visayas regions. But now, as Atar noted, they view the participation of Chinese firms in the rehabilitation of Marawi as an intrusion, if not outright invasion.
Never mind that the heads of four European Parliament groupings responded by calling for Czarnecki’s removal from his post, or that Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, defended Czarnecki. In condemning szmalcowniks, was Czarnecki not admitting that in addition to Poles who saved Jewish lives, there were Poles who sent them to their deaths, as Polish historians like Jan Gross, Irena Grudzińska, Barbara Engelking, Jan Grabowski, Jacek Leociak, Dariusz Stola, and others have thoroughly documented?
The US consumer can no longer serve as the motor of the world economy.ampnbsp; To avoid a global depression other countries must also stimulate their domestic economies.ampnbsp; But periphery countries without large export surpluses are not in a position to employ countercyclical policies.ampnbsp; It is up to the IMF to find ways to finance countercyclical fiscal deficits.ampnbsp; This could be done partly by enlisting sovereign wealth funds and partly by issuing Special Drawing Rights so that rich countries that can finance their own fiscal deficits could cede to poorer countries that cannot.
Для всех финансовых кризисов, имевших место на протяжении последних 20 лет, будь то кризис внешнего долга 1982 года, мексиканский кризис 1994 года, кризис на финансовых рынках стран с развивающейся экономикой 1997-99 годов или же кризис, переживаемый сегодня Турцией и Аргентиной, характерна одна отличительная особенность, – все они охватывали страны, находящиеся на периферии мировой экономики.
Исторически сложилось так, что финансовые кризисы приводили к большему регулированию, включая усиление роли центральных банков и других контрольных органов.
В странах, составляющих ядро мировой экономики, такие образования уже достигли уровня развития, позволяющего им отвращать финансовые неурядицы вроде проблем 1930-х годов.
И действительно, кризис 1997-99 годов может быть хотя бы частично отнесен на счет преждевременного открытия доступа к рынкам капитала развивающихся стран, до того как их финансовые институты оказались способными справиться с этой задачей.
Со времен кризиса 1997-99 годов особое значение придавалось необходимости усиления регулирующих механизмов в странах с развивающейся рыночной экономикой, тем временем, однако, ослабился международный регулирующий механизм. Существует широко распространенное мнение о том, что «спасательные пакеты» МВФ фактически способствовали возникновению кризисов, создавая то, что экономисты называют «моральным риском», т.е. уверенностью со стороны участников свободного рынка, что МВФ непременно придет на выручку находящимся в затруднении странам, тем самым помогая найти выход из положения инвесторам, предоставившим им кредиты.
Спасательные пакеты МВФ, согласно этому мнению, ослабили рыночную дисциплину, стимулируя бум на неразумное, необоснованное предоставление займов. В этом аргументе есть доля истины.
Однако рыночные фундаменталисты ошибаются, полагая, что устранение морального риска – это все, что требуется для создания прочной основы для международной финансовой системы.
Устранение морального риска просто позволит отразить уже само по себе невыгодное положение нахождения на периферии в стоимости и наличии капитала, что сейчас и происходит, хотя пока этого никто не признает.
В ходе кризиса 1997-99 года и последовавших за ним событий МВФ резко изменил свою политику по отношению к частному сектору, начав отказывать в финансовой помощи вместо того, чтобы предоставлять ее.
В результате премия за риск при предоставлении финансирования странам с развивающейся экономикой значительно возросла, в то время как при подсчетах отношения риска к получаемой компенсации обнаружилось смещение в сторону невыгодности инвестирования в страны с развивающейся экономикой. Изменение политики МВФ принесет успех в предотвращении повторения бума на рынки стран с развивающейся экономикой, однако, оно уже создало проблему, работающую в противоположном направлении: высокая стоимость и отсутствие капитала само по себе является новой формой финансового заболевания.
Оно проявляется не только в нехватке иностранных портфельных инвестиций, но и в утечке внутреннего капитала, а также ставит отечественные компании в периферийных странах в заведомо невыгодное положение относительно многонациональных корпораций. Собрав вместе ссуды на жилищное строительство, портфельные инвестиции и частные кредитные потоки, можно сделать вывод о существовании чистой утечки капитала из стран с развивающейся экономикой начиная с 1997 года, превратившейся из положительной размером в 81.7 миллиардов долларов в 1996 году в отрицательную размером в 104.7 миллиардов долларов в 2000 году, компенсируемой лишь слегка увеличившимися притоками прямых иностранных инвестиций и государственным финансированием.
Ошеломляющий показатель - 64% всего мирового чистого экспорта капитала в 2000 году было направлено в Соединенные Штаты в поисках лучших инвестиционных возможностей; для сравнения можно привести средний показатель 1997-99 годов равный 35%.
Ясно, что просто устранения морального риска в глобальной финансовой системе недостаточно, необходимы новые стимулы для создания более «ровного игрового поля» и поощрения направления потока капитала в страны, находящиеся на периферии.
Такие стимулы должны принять форму кредитных поручительств и других усовершенствований в области кредитной политики, которые усилили бы могущество и влияние МВФ в деле предотвращения кризисов в будущем.
Общие принципы очевидны: должен быть лучший баланс между предотвращением кризиса и вмешательством со стороны третьего лица, а также лучший баланс между предложением странам стимулов для ведения разумной политики и наказанием тех, кто этого не делает.
Здесь пересекаются две основные цели: только посредством предложения определенных стимулов МВФ сможет оказывать более сильное влияние на экономическую политику отдельных стран до того, как эта страна обратится к МВФ за помощью в кризисной ситуации.
Наивысшие оценки будут означать автоматический доступ страны к Чрезвычайным Кредитным Линиям, а держатели облигаций получат гарантии, что в случае развертывания программы МВФ их требования будут полностью удовлетворены.
И наоборот, странам, получившим низкие оценки, МВФ заранее даст понять, что не собирается вступать в программу без распределения бремени расходов между государственным и частным сектором.
Могут также быть введены одна или две промежуточные оценки, когда МВФ сможет настаивать на различной степени распределения бремени расходов; • На основе Базельского Соглашения, которое устанавливает признанные во всем мире требования к уровню собственных средств для коммерческих банков, рейтинг МВФ мог бы быть преобразован в показатель изменения потребности в капитале. • Федеральный Резерв, Европейский Центральный Банк, «Бэнк оф Ингланд» (Bank of England) и "Бэнк оф Джапан" (Bank of Japan) могли бы принимать у своих дисконтных окон определенные казначейские векселя, выпущенные тщательно отобранными странами. Эта привилегия может сохраняться для конкретных стран или же использоваться в особо опасных ситуациях.
Например, в настоящее время МВФ не имеет права настаивать на распределении бремени расходов, а также предлагать защиту, сходную с защитой во время банкротства, против судебных исков кредиторов в процессе реорганизации долга (министр финансов Соединенных Штатов О’Нил недавно выразил поддержку такому механизму).
Такие реформы предоставят МВФ и всем его участникам более эффективные средства для предотвращения международных финансовых кризисов и уменьшения экономических несоответствий между странами, находящимися в центре глобальной экономической системы и на ее периферии.
Для их осуществления нам, прежде всего, необходимо преодолеть возражения рыночных фундаменталистов, которые хотят ликвидировать или уменьшить роль МВФ.
NEW YORK – As the United States struggles to understand last September’s attack on its diplomatic mission in Benghazi, which took the lives of four Americans, including US Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, a formal investigation has not even been opened in Libya – and likely never will be. The country’s leaders face myriad challenges – from a vocal federalist movement in the East, aimed at usurping the central government’s prerogatives, to a wave of assassinations targeting security officials – which leaves them few resources to allocate to a case that poses no immediate threat to their domestic standing.
Consider, for example, the Internet-based telecoms firm Skype, created in Estonia; Rovio’s “Angry Birds” video game, made in Finland; the TomTom GPS navigation system, developed in the Netherlands; Navigon, another navigation system, and SoundCloud, a music download service, both made in Germany; Maktoob, an Arabic Internet service provider, and Rubicon, a burgeoning animation educational company, both established in Jordan; and Infosys and Wipro, two of many successful technology ventures in India.
For example, women without "hijab" and a chaperone may not leave their homes; shops shall not advertise the sale of sanitary pads or undergarments; hair-removing creams and lotions may not be sold; use of perfume and makeup will be banned; women will not be allowed to use male tailors; male doctors may not treat women patients; women guests at hotels will not be allowed in the swimming pool; coeducation has been identified as a cause of fornication and is to be phased out; family planning shall be declared un-Islamic, and the sale of contraceptives banned.
In the FA primaries, José Mujica won the presidential nomination by defying Vázquez and placing himself farther to the left than his rival, Danilo Astori, who represented a continuation of the present administration. Mujica has a populist profile, based on charisma, anti-establishment stances and an appeal to the poor, which was strengthened by his personal traits and his lineage as a member of the 1960’s Tupamaros guerrilla movement, as well as his affinity for the ruling Kirchners of Argentina and the “Bolivarian” left.
MELBOURNE – The international military intervention in Libya is not about bombing for democracy or for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s head – let alone keeping oil prices down or profits up. Legally, morally, politically, and militarily, it has only one justification: protecting Libyans from the kind of murderous harm that Qaddafi inflicted on unarmed protestors four weeks ago; has continued to inflict on those who oppose him in the areas that his forces control; and has promised to inflict on his opponents in Benghazi and other rebel-held territory.
But START treaty ratification is going nowhere fast in the US Senate and progress on other key issues has been slow or shaky: bringing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into force; starting negotiations on a new treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons; strengthening the non-proliferation regime with effective measures to detect violations and deter treaty walk-outs; reaching agreement on some form of international management of the most sensitive aspects of the fuel cycle; and, above all, starting new rounds of serious disarmament talks, involving not just the two nuclear superpowers, but all eight nuclear-armed states.
“devotes himself forever to the pursuit of wealth and greatness....With the most unrelenting industry he labors night and day....serves those whom he hates, and is obsequious to those whom he despises....[I]n the last dregs of life, his body wasted with toil and diseases, his mind galled and ruffled by the memory of a thousand injuries and disappointments....he begins at last to find that wealth and greatness are mere trinkets of frivolous utility....Power and riches....keep off the summer shower, not the winter storm, but leave him always as much, and sometimes more exposed than before, to anxiety, to fear, and to sorrow; to diseases, to danger, and to death...”
The counter-script for establishing or restoring pro-democratic conditions consists of more mass protest; the appearance and display of resistance symbols; the emergence of enough spokespeople throughout society that all of them cannot be arrested at once; overt civil and covert disobedience, at every level of society, that brings the economy to a halt; withdrawal of support by lawyers and judges for the regime’s decisions; international sanctions tied to human rights and clean elections; the refusal – tricky but not unattainable – of many soldiers and police to fire at unarmed citizens; and, finally, when the rule of law is reestablished, serious prosecutions of the defeated regime’s ringleaders.
So we have Paul Samuelson, the author of the postwar era’s landmark economics textbook, reminding his fellow economists that China’s gains in globalization may well come at the expense of the US; Paul Krugman, today’s foremost international trade theorist, arguing that trade with low-income countries is no longer too small to have an effect on inequality; Alan Blinder, a former US Federal Reserve vice chairman, worrying that international outsourcing will cause unprecedented dislocations for the US labor force; Martin Wolf, the Financial Times columnist and one of the most articulate advocates of globalization, writing of his disappointment with how financial globalization has turned out; and Larry Summers, the US Treasury chief and the Clinton administration’s “Mr. Globalization,” musing about the dangers of a race to the bottom in national regulations and the need for international labor standards.
But even as these efforts are gathering momentum, The Financial Times, which used to be a staunch supporter of multilateral free trade, dropped a cluster bomb on Doha, even congratulating itself that, in 2008 (when a ministerial meeting failed to reach closure), it “argued that leaders should admit the negotiations were dead.” But if skeptics forget Mark Twain’s famous response to a mistaken obituary – “The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated” – were the negotiators who have continued to work since then akin to Gogol’s “dead souls?”
Challenging the “myth of the autocratic revival,” the American political scientists Daniel Deudney and John Ikenberry have examined China and Russia, finding “little evidence for the emergence of a stable equilibrium between capitalism and autocracy such that this combination could be dignified as a new model of modernity.” While neither country qualifies as a liberal democracy, both “are much more liberal and democratic than they have ever been, and many of the crucial foundations for sustainable liberal democracy are emerging” – one main hurdle being the centrifugal forces that democracy might unleash.
In the periphery, the trillion-dollar bailout package and the non-stressful “stress tests” kicked the can down the road, but the fundamental problems remain: large budget deficits and stocks of public debt that will be hard to reduce sufficiently, given weak governments and public backlash against fiscal austerity and structural reforms; large current-account deficits and private-sector foreign liabilities that will be hard to rollover and service; loss of competitiveness (driven by a decade-long loss of market share in labor-intensive exports to emerging markets, rising unit labor costs, and the strength of the euro until 2008); low potential and actual growth; and massive risks to banks and financial institutions (with the exception of Italy).
Thus the only plausible case for a way out of the worldwide Great Depression in 1931 lay, as the great economic historian Charles Kindleberger emphasized, with some step from the US. At the time, there were all kinds of convincing reasons why Americans should not want to take on the burden of a worldwide rescue: sending more money to Europe might be seen as pouring money down a drain; had not the Europeans fought a World War that had been the fount and origin of the financial mess? Economically such action would have made a great deal of sense from a long term perspective; but politically it was a non-starter with no short term payoff at all.
What do the victories of two relatively inexperienced outsiders, Barak Obama and Mike Huckabee, in the Iowa Caucuses mean for American foreign policy in general and the Atlantic Alliance in particular? It is too soon to predict, on the basis of a plurality of votes cast by a sliver of eligible voters in a small state, who will eventually prevail in the nomination process. But it is not too soon to ask if the Bush Administration’s unfathomably cavalier and gratuitously alienating attitude toward America’s European allies will change substantially on January 20, 2009.
Commentators seem to agree that the voters who chose Obama and Huckabee felt that they were rejecting the status quo. To put the missteps of the past behind them, they apparently voted for the candidates about whom they knew the least. But exactly what status quo did they imagine they were rejecting? Upon inspection, the “politics as usual” that they apparently sought to rebuff looks nebulous. Obama has repeatedly linked Hillary Clinton, whose political team is personally and ideologically committed to wresting power from the current incumbents, to the thinking dominant in Washington from 2001 to 2007. Even more oddly, the genial and erratic Huckabee says that the Mormon former governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, represents the powers that be.
To focus the discussion, we can ask the following question: Did the status quo rejected by the Obama’s and Huckabee’s voters include the deterioration of American-European relations under the Presidency of George W. Bush? After all, the current Administration’s denigration of “old Europe” was not just a rhetorical aside, but a centerpiece of its reckless approach to foreign affairs. That is why any serious break with the disastrous Bush legacy should start with rethinking and rebuilding the Atlantic Alliance. That a renewed Atlanticism would be a priority for either Obama or Huckabee is extremely doubtful, however.
Relations between the US and Europe have gone virtually unmentioned in the dozens of Presidential debates held over the past six months. This is not surprising. Candidates have no incentive to focus attention on a subject, such as the strained Atlantic Alliance, that seldom if ever enters the consciousness of the average voter. Obama’s failure to convene a single policy meeting of the Senate European sub-committee which he chairs (a committee that oversees, among other things, US relations with NATO and the EU) has had absolutely zero resonance among the electorate at large. When the topic arises, the Republican candidates, for their part, seem less blandly indifferent than overtly hostile to Europe. Their anti-European animus, while crudely uninformed, reflects, among other factors, the scorn for secularism typical of Southern white evangelicals and the perverse notion promulgated by some distinguished Republican defense intellectuals that Europe today can contribute little or nothing to American security.
Third, the narcissism of small differences and Bush’s war aside, Americans and Europeans share a common way of life and cultural commitment to tolerant individualism that is not found with the same intensity, concentration, and unchallenged dominance in most of the rest of the world. Europeans and Americans also face many of the same foreign policy challenges. These include not just terrorism, but also politically destabilizing immigration pressures caused by the wealth gap between North and South, the job-destroying expansion of low-wage labor in China, Putin’s unpredictable petro-politics, nuclear proliferation involving politically unstable countries, contagious disease, global warming, and so forth. It would be culturally suicidal for “the West” not to work together to devise ways to manage these immensely difficult problems.
Cohen and Zysman argued that manufactures were related to services like “the crop duster to the cotton fields, the ketchup maker to the tomato patch,” and that if you “[o]ffshore the tomato farm…you close or offshore the ketchup plant….No two ways about it.” My reaction was: “[A]s I read the profound assertion about the tomato farm and the ketchup plant, I was eating my favorite Crabtree ampamp; Evelyn vintage marmalade.
And that, in turn, has important consequences: as Jack Fisher, a professor of surgery at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, observed, “Keep crying ‘wolf,’ and WHO can expect lower than customary compliance with flu vaccine advisories next fall.” Worse, imagine what would happen when we encounter a genuinely dangerous new pathogen, such as a strain of H5N1 avian flu (which in its current form has a mortality rate more than 100 times higher than H1N1) that is easily transmissible between humans.
This looming global recession is being fed by several factors: the collapse of housing bubbles in the US, United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland and other euro-zone members; punctured credit bubbles where money and credit was too easy for too long; the severe credit and liquidity crunch following the US mortgage crisis; the negative wealth and investment effects of falling stock markets (already down by more than 20% globally); the global effects via trade links of the recession in the US (which still counts for about 30% of global GDP); the US dollar’s weakness, which reduces American trading partners’ competitiveness; and the stagflationary effects of high oil and commodity prices, which are forcing central banks to increase interest rates to fight inflation at a time when there are severe downside risks to growth and financial stability.
People in the territory of what is now Slovakia have lived in seven different states and under five different political systems in the 20th century, from the liberal autocracy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1901-1918), through the liberal democracy of the inter-war Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1939), to the fascist wartime Slovak state (1939-1945), back to a Czechoslovak liberal democracy (1945-1948), then to the communist Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (1948-1989), the liberal democracy of the Czechoslovak Federative Republic (1989-1992).
From the castle, the line wound down the steep hills of Malá Strana, past the great Baroque cathedral, its ornate spires lighted in the snowy night, down Mostecká Street with its cafes and restaurants, across the shimmering Vltava at Charles Bridge, with its 400-year-old statues of Czech kings and religious saviors, through the narrow streets of the Old Town and finally into Wenceslas Square, where I watched three policemen join the procession, their caps set at jaunty angles, dancing along in tall black leather boots.
Dennis Robertson, an early twentieth-century “real” business-cycle theorist, wrote: “I do not feel confident that a policy which, in the pursuit of stability of prices, output, and employment, had nipped in the bud the English railway boom of the forties, or the American railway boom of 1869-71, or the German electrical boom of the nineties, would have been on balance beneficial to the populations concerned.” Like his contemporary, Schumpeter, Robertson regarded these boom-bust cycles, which involved both the creation of new capital and the destruction of old capital, as inseparable from progress.
He thought that it was important to confront the fact of our insignificant place in the universe, because he did not want us to live under the illusory comfort of a belief that somehow the world had been created for our sake, and that we are under the benevolent care of an all-powerful creator. “Dreams and Facts” concludes with these stirring words: “No man is liberated from fear who dare not see his place in the world as it is; no man can achieve the greatness of which he is capable until he has allowed himself to see his own littleness.”
I tried to explain that his trademark phrase, en même temps (at the same time), which tends to be heard here as an expression of American-style pragmatism, may instead be one of the most visible traces of his doctrinal proximity to the French Protestant philosopher Paul Ricœur. Far from reflecting careful deliberation over an ambiguous choice, “at the same time” is the credo of someone suspended in fear and trembling before the unsolvable and terrifying mystery of the double nature – physical and spiritual, mortal and resurrected – of the tormented body of Christ.
In addition, the UN regular budget includes allocations for the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN Development Program, the World Health Organization, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN’s regional bodies (for Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America), the UN Environment Program, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (for disaster response), the World Meteorological Organization, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, UN Women (for women’s rights), and many other agencies, each specializing in global responses to crises, conflicts, poverty, displacement, environmental hazards, diseases, or other public needs.
Since 2010, the following major financial institutions paid fines for violating US sanctions: Banco do Brasil, Bank of America, Bank of Guam, Bank of Moscow, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Clearstream Banking, Commerzbank, Compass, Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, JP Morgan Chase, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, National Bank of Pakistan, PayPal, RBS (ABN Amro), Société Générale, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Trans-Pacific National Bank (now known as Beacon Business Bank), Standard Chartered, and Wells Fargo.
The question for me is how these three men with such different backgrounds and trajectories – Khrushchev, a Russian peasant turned proletarian who became General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party; Király, a Magyar soldier of old world Europe, steeped in aristocratic traditions; and Kolakowski, a gentleman scholar from Warsaw more attuned to Jansenist heresies than the perverse logic of Leninist dialectics – could ultimately contribute to the same goal: the resurrection of liberty in Europe.
As it struggles to form a government for the Palestinian territories, Hamas seems to be clutching to the Biblical verses in Ecclesiasties rather than the desires of the Quartet (the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations) charged with trying to bridge the Israeli-Palestinian divide. “To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven,” fits Hamas’s current agenda because its priorities and time frame are different from those of the international community, which is pressing it to make immediate political declarations, most importantly, to recognize Israel’s right to exist.
This would not mean ruling out a deserving American candidate such as Hillary Clinton, but it would also mean looking carefully at others, such as former Presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico; Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the economics czarina in Nigeria; Mo Ibrahim, an exemplar of African business success; Nandan Nilekani, the Indian software mogul-turned-development-official; and Andrew Sheng of Malaysia, a distinguished former financial regulator.
Football chauvinism always contained an edge of violence, for it often included an ethnic, religious, or class component: Protestants versus Catholics (in Scotland); “Jewish” clubs (in Amsterdam, Berlin, London, and Budapest), taunted by fans who opposed the “Yids”; posh clubs (like Galatasaray in Istanbul) and resolutely proletarian sides (West Ham in London); clubs that took pride in a strong regional identity (Barcelona); and clubs that were close to the centers of power (Real Madrid).
Gordon distinguishes three Industrial Revolutions that have driven economic growth and improved living standards since the eighteenth century: IR #1 (“steam, railroads”), whose defining inventions date from 1750 to 1830; IR #2 (“electricity, internal combustion engine, running water, indoor toilets, communications, entertainment, chemicals, petroleum”), whose defining inventions date from 1870 to 1900; and IR #3 (“computers, the web, mobile phones”), dating from 1960.
